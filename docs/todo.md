Crucial:
-   how does angle averaging work?
-   visualize energy function
-   why normalization
-   average confidence into docs

Nice to have:
-   add how this maps to real world case into docs
-   visualize how far the cat sees
-   observation window size (number of observations in horizontally and vertically)
-   normalization method
-   z-index of heatmap positions?
-   number of inference iterations
-   energy function variant
-   maybe different energy function variants?
-   fix scrolling

Done:
-   number of angles
-   pattern dimension
-   which angle is shown when hovering?
