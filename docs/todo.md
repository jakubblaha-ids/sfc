-   visualize how far the cat sees
-   fix scrollingj

Other tweakable settings:

-   number of angles
-   pattern dimension
-   number of inference iterations
-   normalization method
-   number of stored patterns
-   observation window size (number of observations in horizontally and vertically)
-   energy function variant
-   change hopfield.py to mhn.py
-   reame camera_simpulator to camera.py
-   rename localization_engine to localization.py
-   add how this maps to real world case into docs
-   how does angle averaging work?
-   z-index of heatmap positions?
-   which angle is shown when hovering?
-   should include the energy function
-   settings of update iterations?
-   why normalization
-   maybe different energy function variants?

Then also fix the settable parameters in the documentation.
