Crucial:
-   noise to docs
-   why normalization
-   maybe change angle averaging?
-   energy heatmap
-   convergence mode
-   plot of energy function during convergence

Nice to have:
-   add how this maps to real world case into docs
-   visualize how far the cat sees
-   observation window size (number of observations in horizontally and vertically)
-   normalization method
-   z-index of heatmap positions?
-   number of inference iterations
-   energy function variant
-   maybe different energy function variants?
-   fix scrolling
-   realtime energy updates

Done:
-   number of angles
-   pattern dimension
-   which angle is shown when hovering?
-   average confidence into docs
